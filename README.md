## Project Summary

In this project, I have applied the skills you have acquired in this course to operationalize a Machine Learning Microservice API. 

You are given a pre-trained, `sklearn` model that has been trained to predict housing prices in Boston according to several features, such as average rooms in a home and data about highway access, teacher-to-pupil ratios, and so on. You can read more about the data, which was initially taken from Kaggle, on [the data source site](https://www.kaggle.com/c/boston-housing).This project is using a flask app 'app.py'-that serves out predictions (inference) about housing prices through API calls. This project could be extended to any pre-trained machine learning model, such as those for image recognition and data labeling.

## Setup the Environment

* Create a virtualenv and activate it
* Run `make install` to install the necessary dependencies

### Running `app.py`

1. Standalone:  `python app.py`
2. Run in Docker:  `./run_docker.sh`
3. Run in Kubernetes:  `./run_kubernetes.sh`
s
### Kubernetes Steps

* Setup and Configure Docker locally
* Setup and Configure Kubernetes locally
* Create Flask app in Container
* Run via kubectl

## Testing the app

* Run : ./make_prediction.sh <host_port>
  e.g. I'm forwarding port 8080 of my host machine to my docker container's port 80 then the script would run like : ./make_prediction.sh 8080

* Test in your browser:
  e.g http://localhost:8080
